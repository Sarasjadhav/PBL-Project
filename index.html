        <h2><b>Water as a Source</b></h2>
        <p>
            Water is like the ultimate life-support system. We need it to stay alive, plain and simple. When we drink it,
            our bodies stay hydrated and happy. Water also helps us stay clean by washing away dirt and germs. But it's not
            just about us humans—water is essential for growing the food we eat and generating electricity through things
            like hydroelectric dams. Nature thrives on water too; it provides homes for all sorts of plants and animals.
            And let's not forget the fun part—swimming, fishing, and just splashing around are all possible because of
            water. In short, water is our lifeline, keeping us healthy, powering our world, and providing endless
            opportunities for enjoyment and discovery.

        <h2><b>About Water</b></h2>
        <p>
            97% of the water on the Earth is salt water. However, only 3% percent is fresh water; slightly over 2/3 of this
            is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater,
            with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air. On the surface of the earth, 71% is covered by
            seas and oceans, and the remaining 29% is occupied by land. Freshwater is a renewable resource.
